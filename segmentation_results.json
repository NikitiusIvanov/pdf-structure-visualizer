On the other hand, a role of NLRP in the regulation of Paneth cells functions (which produce ANG4) has been observed 43 . Furthermore, IL-18, as NLRP3 downstream, has been identified to play a crucial role in the maintenance of intestinal integrity 18 .

In line with this, our study showed a prominent role of the diet-induced dysbiosis on AMPs secretion and an inflammasome-dependent downregulation of ANG4, an intestinal protein with important antibacterial functions. Thus, a plausible explana- tion of the observed higher intestinal permeability in Nlrp3 \u2212 / \u2212 -HFHC mice is that the altered antimicrobial activ- ity, induced by the combination of a Western-lifestyle diet with NLRP3 deficiency, leads to increased abundance", "type": "Text"}, {"left": 155.0, "top": 489.0, "width": 401.0, "height": 158.0, "page_number": 10, "page_width": 595, "page_height": 782, "text": "of mucus degrading bacteria, thus favoring the passage of pathogens into the portal circulation.

Chronic overfeeding leads to macrophage in \ufb01 ltration in the adipose tissue, resulting in proin \ufb02 ammatory cytokine production. Both microbial and endogenous danger signals trigger assembly of the intracellular innate immune sensor Nlrp3, resulting in caspase-1 activation and production of proin \ufb02 ammatory cytokines IL-1 \u03b2 and IL-18. Here, we showed that mice de \ufb01 cient in Nlrp3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein, and caspase-1 were resistant to the development of high-fat diet-induced obesity, which correlated with protection from obesity- induced insulin resistance. Furthermore, hepatic triglyceride content, adipocyte size, and macrophage in \ufb01 ltration in adipose tissue were all reduced in mice de \ufb01 cient in in \ufb02 ammasome components. Monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 is a key molecule that mediates macrophage in \ufb01 ltration.

NLRs comprise a large family of intracellular proteins that are believed to be primarily involved in the innate immune response to microbial pathogens through the recognition of conserved pathogen-associated molecular pat- terns (1 \u2013 3). However, NLRs also contribute to in \ufb02 ammation by sensing \u201c danger signals \u201d (i.e., endogenous molecules that are pro- duced during tissue damage or in \ufb02 ammation) (3 \u2013 5). A prominent example of an NLR protein implicated in autoin \ufb02 ammatory dis- ease is Nlrp3 (also called Cryopyrin) (6). Nlrp3 activation induces the recruitment and autocatalytic activation of the cystein protease caspase-1 in a large cytosolic protein complex named the \u201c in \ufb02 am- masome \u201d (2 \u2013 7). The bipartite adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis- associated speck-like protein) bridges the interaction between Nlrp3 and the caspase-1 by means of homotypic interactions in- volving its pyrin and CARD motifs, making it essential for activa- tion of the in \ufb02 ammasome (7). Activated caspase-1 processes the cytosolic precursors of the related cytokines IL-1 \u03b2 and IL-18, thus allowing secretion of the biologically active cytokines. Hence, mice lacking caspase-1 are defective in the maturation and secretion of IL-1 \u03b2 and IL-18 (8 \u2013 10). IL-1 \u03b2 participates in the generation of systemic and local responses to infection, injury, and immunologi- cal challenges by inducing the \u201c acute phase response \u201d character- ized by fever, synthesis of acute phase proteins, and leukocytosis (11). Although IL-18 lacks the pyrogenic activity of IL-1 \u03b2 , it is in- volved in the induction of several secondary proin \ufb02 ammatory cytokines, chemokines, and cell-adhesion molecules (12, 13).", "type": "Text"}, {"left": 301.0, "top": 207.0, "width": 246.0, "height": 224.0, "page_number": 1, "page_width": 584, "page_height": 782, "text": "Obesity is accompanied by the development of a chronic low- grade in \ufb02 ammation that is promoted by expanding adipose tissue (14, 15). Expansion of fat mass characterized by adipocyte en- largement fuels the in \ufb01 ltration of macrophages into the adipose tissue (16, 17). The enhanced in \ufb02 ammatory trait of the adipose tissue instigates the production of cytokines that contribute to the development of insulin resistance (18, 19). IL-1 \u03b2 and IL-18 have also been linked to the development of obesity-induced insulin resistance. IL-1 \u03b2 has been reported to inhibit adipocyte differ- entiation (20), but the absence of IL-18 induced obesity and in- sulin resistance (21, 22). Moreover, high-fat diet (HFD) feeding resulted in the activation of caspase-1 in adipose tissue in mice (23). Interestingly, absence of NLRP3 has recently been shown to prevent the development of obesity-induced insulin resitance (24). However, the role of caspase-1 and the in \ufb02 ammasome member ASC in the development of HFD-induced obesity has not been characterized. Chronic activation of in \ufb02 ammasome-mediated caspase-1 activity may underlie the development of obesity-induced insulin resistance.

Immunohistochemical localization of macrophages in WAT of HFD-fed animals showed a reduction in the number of macro- phages in Casp1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice (Fig. 4 E ). These results were con \ufb01 rmed by qPCR analysis of the macrophage marker CD68 in WAT (Fig. 4 F ). Additionally, as monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)- 1 is responsible for macrophage in \ufb02 ux (27), we analyzed protein levels of MCP-1 in adipose tissue of HFD-fed animals.

To acquire more information regarding the molecular pathways controlled by caspase-1 in adipose tissue during HFD- feeding, we performed a microarray analysis comparing HFD- fed wild-type and Casp1 \u2212 / \u2212 animals (Fig. 4 H and Figs. S6 \u2013 S8 ) that revealed a substantial overlap of pathways regulated in both Casp1 \u2212 / \u2212 and ASC \u2212 / \u2212 animals, including cell cycle and immu- nometabolism that encompasses functional gene sets involved in both immunity and metabolism.

We further analyzed the role of the in \ufb02 ammasome in obesity by examining energy expenditure, fecal output, and ca- loric content in HFD-fed wild-type and Casp1 \u2212 / \u2212 animals. De- tailed analysis of the food intake revealed that, although the absence of caspase-1 protects against the development of obe- sity, Casp1 \u2212 / \u2212 animals eat more compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 5 A ). However, as shown in Fig. 5 B , fecal output was sig- ni \ufb01 cantly enhanced in Casp1 \u2212 / \u2212 animals. Analysis of the fat content of the feces, as determined by the percentage of stea- tocrit, revealed no signi \ufb01 cant difference between both genotypes (Fig. 5 C ). Finally, caloric content of the feces did not differ between both genotypes on the HFD (Fig. 5 D ), suggesting that the net energy intake is similar in HFD-fed wild-type and Casp1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice. However, although total daily caloric intake was highly similar, feeding behavior was strikingly different between wild-type and Casp1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice ( Fig. S9 A ). Whereas wild-type animals displayed a constant intake, the Casp1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice were characterized by the consumption of relatively large amounts of food followed by periods in which the animals did not eat at all. Inasmuch gut hormones are known to control food intake, we measured circulating concentrations of GIP, PYY, and ghrelin before and 2 h after the administration of a lipid bolus. Circu- lating postprandial levels of the satiety signals GIP and PYY were not different between both phenotypes ( Fig. S9 B ). In contrast, whereas circulating levels of ghrelin were reduced in wild-type animals after receiving the lipid bolus ( Fig. S9 B ), this postprandial reduction was not observed in Casp1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice, sug- gesting that an orexigenic action of ghrelin may contribute to modulation of the feeding pattern. In contrast, analysis of the energy expenditure in HFD-fed caspase-1 \u2013 de \ufb01 cient mice un- veiled signi \ufb01 cantly higher energy expenditure (Fig. 5 E and F ).

Whereas the secretion of proin \ufb02 ammatory cytokines is enhanced, the production of insulin-sensitizing adipokines, such as adiponectin, is reduced. To date, several proin \ufb02 ammatory cytokines have been linked to the development of insulin resistance, including IL-1 \u03b2 and IL-18 (14). These cytokines are both produced as inactive precursors in the cytosol and are released following their maturation by the cysteine protease caspase-1. The cytosolic zymogen form of caspase-1 consists of an N-terminal prodomain that is processed and activated within the in \ufb02 ammasomes, which are assembled on NLR protein scaffolds. Because of the metabolic effects de- scribed for IL-1 \u03b2 and IL-18, and because of the crucial role of the in \ufb02 ammasome in the activation of these cytokines, we set out to test the role of the in \ufb02 ammasome in obesity. Our studies demonstrate that the mice de \ufb01 cient in in \ufb02 ammasome compo- nents are protected from HFD-associated body-weight gain, adipocyte hypertrophy, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperresistinemia. Importantly, HFD-induced production of the protein resistin was signi \ufb01 cantly reduced in in \ufb02 ammasome-de \ufb01 cient animals, imply- ing its critical role in driving the in \ufb02 ammatory potential of adi- pocytes.

Although changes in adipogenic gene expression in caspase-1 and ASC-de \ufb01 cient animals show a con- siderable overlap, subtle differences exist. Whereas ASC may mediate effects on adipocyte hypertrophy, as observed in Casp- 1 \u2212 / \u2212 animals, macrophage in \ufb02 ux in the ASC \u2212 / \u2212 animals may partly be regulated independently of caspase-1. In this regard, recent studies reported that ASC directly mediates gene ex- pression (28) and has a critical role in the development of ex- perimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and arthritis inde- pendently of the in \ufb02 ammasome (29, 30).

Although part of the protective effects in HFD-fed Casp1 \u2212 / \u2212 animals are explained by the absence or lower levels of IL-1 \u03b2 , caspase-1 may also control alternative pathways. The wide range of genes differentially regulated between HFD-fed wild- type and Casp1 \u2212 / \u2212 animals support the hypothesis of novel functions of caspase-1 in adipose tissue. In addition, the increase in energy expenditure observed in Casp1 \u2212 / \u2212 animals identi \ufb01 es caspase-1 as a metabolic regulator. Finally, caspase-1 appears to drive the production of different chemokines in adipose tissue that regulated in \ufb02 ammatory cell in \ufb02 ux. We postulate that cas- pase-1 downstream signaling contributes to the enhanced energy expenditure observed in HFD-fed Casp1 \u2212 / \u2212 animals.

Interestingly, ceramide, a lipid molecule, has been described as a potent danger signal for in \ufb02 ammasome activation (24).

Whether inhibition of vanin activity is causally involved in the development of steatosis during obesity remains unknown.

However, our experiments show that neither genetic absence ( Vnn1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice) nor pharmacological inhibition of total vanin activity by RR6 affects hepatic steatosis in animal models of obesity. Thus vanin-1 expression appears to prevent excessive accumulation of TG in the liver during fasting 1 , but not in response to HFD-feeding. This suggests that the observed increase in vanin-1 expression in steatotic livers of obese mice, may rather be a marker of enhanced PPAR \u03b1 activation, without causal involvement of vanin-1 in the progression or prevention of steatosis during obesity. Our data show that the increased expression of Vnn1 in steatotic livers concurs with an increase in total plasma vanin activity.

Therefore, the effect of vanin-1 on these pathological hepatic processes needs careful future evaluation in more appropriate experimental settings. The HFD-fed C57Bl/6 mouse is a suitable mouse model to evaluate development of adipose tissue inflammation during obesity. Indeed, HFD-feeding in the current study clearly induced adipose tissue inflammation.

Although we observed a strong upregulation of hepatic Vnn1 expression and plasma vanin activity in obese, insulin resistant mice and rats, our results suggest that vanin-1 only plays a minor role in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance. Whereas the complete absence of vanin-1 led to an increase in insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance after a long term HFD-intervention in mice, short-term inhibition of vanin activity had no beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity or hepatic glucose production in diabetic rats. These results suggest that the contribution of vanin-1 to the development of insulin resistance is rather indirect. Another explanation for the differences observed in RR6-treated rats and Vnn1 \u2212 / \u2212 mice could possibly be that not vanin activity, but the presence of vanin-1 protein may be (mildly) involved in the development of insulin resistance. The recently revealed structure of vanin-1 by X-ray crystallography suggests that it could operate both as an enzyme and a signaling protein 20 .

Our findings in HFD-fed mice are partly in contrast with Chen et al. , who demonstrated increased hepatic glucose production and insulin resistance upon activation of vanin-1 using adenovirus vanin-1 (adVnn1), while inhibition of vanin-1 using siRNA against VNN1 reduced these processes in an obese mouse model 2 .

Additionally, the effect of liver-specific and short-term (3 days) modulation of vanin-1 activity by siRNA done by Chen et al. versus total inhibition of vanin-1 activity in our study may have differential outcomes on systemic glycemic control.

Here, we reveal that mice lacking ACSS2 exhibit a significant reduction in body weight and hepatic steatosis in a diet-induced obesity model. ACSS2 deficiency reduces dietary lipid absorption by the intestine and also perturbs repartitioning and utilization of triglycerides from adipose tissue to the liver due to lowered expression of lipid transporters and fatty acid oxidation genes.

Moreover, fatty acid transporters are also down-regulated in Acss2 \u2212 / \u2212 enterocytes (Fig. 3 D \u2013 F ), leading to less dietary lipid absorption (Fig. 3 C ) and more lipid in the feces (Fig. 3 B ), which further contribute to lowered serum lipid content (Fig. 1 G \u2013 I ).

These pheno- types are consistent with the idea that the retrieval of mitochondrial acetate mediated by ACSS1 contributes to mitochondrial energetics and thermogenesis especially on starvation or cold shock. In con- trast, the phenotypes reported here give evidence that ACSS2 may promote systemic fat utilization and storage through the selective, coordinated regulation of gene expression across multiple tissues.

Less obvious, by contrast, is a logical consideration of how the ACSS2 enzyme might facilitate adaptation to starved condi- tions? In this regard we are reminded of histones as a depot for acetate storage (6, 19). Studies of yeast cells under fed or starved conditions have given evidence that the yeast ACS enzymes help facilitate, under conditions of fuel abundance, the acetylation of histone tails associated with genes involved in cell growth (20). Under conditions of starvation, these enzymes recapture acetate resulting from histone deacetylation and promote redistribution of this acetate to histone tails associated with genes required for adaptation to starvation (20).

The target tissue and cellular mechanism of MetAP2 inhibitors, however, have not been extensively examined. Using com- pounds with diverse chemical scaffolds, we showed that MetAP2 inhibition decreases body weight and fat mass and increases lean mass in the obese mice but not in the lean mice. Obesity is associated with catecholamine resistance and blunted \u2424 -adrenergic receptor signaling activities, which could dampen lipolysis and energy expenditure resulting in weight gain. In the current study, we examined effect of MetAP2 inhibition on brown adipose tissue and brown adipocytes. Norepinephrine increases energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue by provid- ing fatty acid substrate through lipolysis and by increasing expression of uncoupled protein-1 (UCP1). Metabolomic anal- ysis shows that in response to MetAP2 inhibitor treatment, fatty acid metabolites in brown adipose tissue increase transiently and subsequently decrease to basal or below basal levels, sug- gesting an effect on fatty acid metabolism in this tissue. Treat- ment of brown adipocytes with MetAP2 inhibitors enhances norepinephrine-induced lipolysis and energy expenditure, and prolongs the activity of norepinephrine to increase ucp1 gene expression and energy expenditure in norepinephrine-desensi- tized brown adipocytes. In summary, we showed that the anti- obesity activity of MetAP2 inhibitors can be mediated, at least in part, through direct action on brown adipocytes by enhancing \u2424 -adrenergic\u2013signaling\u2013stimulated activities.", "type": "Text"}, {"left": 39.0, "top": 554.0, "width": 252.0, "height": 79.0, "page_number": 1, "page_width": 594, "page_height": 783, "text": "Inhibitors of methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) 2 such as TNP-470 and fumagillin reduced body weight in ob/ob and high-fat diet\u2013induced obese mice ( 1\u20134 ).

The anti-obesity effect of MetAP2 inhibition has been hypothesized to be at least partly through the adipose tissue. However, direct effect of MetAP2 inhibitors on adipose tissue and adipocytes has not been demonstrated. In humans, beloranib treatment increases plasma \u2424 -hydroxybutyrate, adiponectin, and FGF-21 levels and decreases fat mass and leptin levels, suggesting fatty acid metabolism and energy expenditure may be involved ( 8 ). In mice, MetAP2 inhibitor treatment increases energy expendi- ture in ob/ob and high-fat diet\u2013induced obese mice ( 1, 2 ). Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a thermogenic tissue important for regulating energy expenditure. Its presence in adult humans has been demonstrated and increasing BAT activity is proposed to be a promising obesity therapeutic approach ( 9 ).

Sestrins and Nrf2 are of interest to re- searchers as they are known to protect against inflammation and oxidative stress. In this study, we aim to explore the interconnection between Sestrin2 (SESN2) and Nrf2 and their roles in exercise benefits on chronic inflam- mation. Our data showed that SESN2 knockout aggravated the abnormalities of body weight, fat mass, and serum lipid that were induced by a high-fat diet (HFD), and a concomitant increase of TNF- \u03b1 , IL-1 \u03b2 and IL-6 in both serum and skeletal muscle.

Furthermore,  our  data  demonstrated  that  SESN2 protein is necessary for exercise-induced effects on Nrf2 pathway in HFD-fed mice, and Nrf2 protein is necessary to enable SESN2 to reduce the inflammation caused by palmitic acid (PA) + oleic acid (OA) treatment in vitro.

There are three isoforms in vertebrates including  Sestrin1  (SESN1),  Sestrin2  (SESN2)  and  Sestrin3  (SESN3) [ 4 , 13 ]. Several studies have demonstrated the positive effects of SESN2 in  various  conditions.  For  instance,  SESN2  inhibits  lipogenesis  and inflammation in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) induced by HFD via AMPK/mTOR pathway [ 14 ]. Additionally, overexpression of SESN2  could  inhibit  the  expression  of  proinflammatory  cytokines induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), contributing to the improvement of inflammatory diseases [ 15 ]. Our previous study further showed that overexpression of SESN2 reduced lipid biosynthesis through inhibition of JNK in palmitate-treated C2C12 [ 16 ]. Recent evidence indicates that SESNs could mimic the physiological effects of exercise [ 17 ], suggesting that  SESN2  could  be  evolutionarily  conserved  mediators  of  exercise benefits.  Our  previous  data  revealed  that  regular  exercise  improves mitochondrial  dysfunction  of  sarcopenia  and  abnormal  glucose-lipid metabolism induced-HFD, and a concomitant increase of SESN2 pro- tein expression in the skeletal muscle [ 4 , 16 , 18 , 19 ]. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the acute aerobic exercise induces autophagy and increases the protein expression of SESN2 in the skeletal muscle [ 20 ].

Generally, Nrf2 exerts its functions through the interaction with Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) [ 21 ]. Under normal conditions, Nrf2 binds to Keap1 to regulate proteasomal degradation.  However,  when  oxidative  stress  occurs,  the  interaction between Nrf2 and Keap1 is disrupted, allowing Nrf2 to translocate to the nucleus  and  control  a  variety  of  downstream  antioxidant  and  anti- inflammatory genes [ 21 ]. It has been reported that knockout of Nrf2 increases the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF- \u03b1 , IL-1 \u03b2 , IL- 6 and IL-8) induced by LPS and increases the TLR4, p-I \u03ba B \u03b1 /I \u03ba B \u03b1 , and p- p65/p65 proteins expression in goat endometrial epithelial cells [ 23 ]. In addition, red ginseng-derived saponin fraction suppresses the obesity- induced inflammatory responses via Nrf2-HO-1 pathway in adipocyte- macrophage co-culture system [ 24 ]. Further evidence of exercise pro- moting  Nrf2  expression  in  skeletal  muscle  has  been  demonstrated [ 25 , 26 ]. Studies have shown that long-term exercise intervention im- proves  skeletal  muscle  function  and  restores  the  sarcopenia-like phenotype in C57BL/6 J mice, which is accompanied by an increase in the mRNA level of Nrf2 [ 25 ]. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that  4-week of  voluntary  wheel  running increases Nrf2  translocation into nuclei, as well as Nrf2 DNA-binding activity in association with increased  p62  phosphorylation  (Ser351)  in  mouse  oxidative  skeletal muscle [ 26 ]. Collectively, there evidences demonstrate that both SESN2 and  Nrf2  are  regulated  by  exercise,  and  have  powerful  anti- inflammatory  effects.  However,  the  relationship  between  SESN2  and Nrf2 remains unclear.

Molecular and cellular process of chronic inflammation is varied and depends on the type of inflamed cells and organ [ 33 ]. Exercise has been found to reduce chronic inflammation in  obesity,  while  its  underlying  mechanisms  remain  unclear.  The possible  mechanisms  include  reducing  the  expressions  of  pro- inflammatory  factors  [ 34 ],  enhancing  the  expressions  of  anti- inflammatory cytokines [ 34 ], inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activa- tion [ 35 ] and reducing ROS production [ 36 ] in many tissues including blood  and  skeletal  muscles.  We  found  that  aerobic  exercise  still decreased the content of TNF- \u03b1 , IL-1 \u03b2 and IL-6 in the serum of SESN2 \u2212 / \u2212 mice, suggesting that SESN2 is not essential for the regulation of aerobic exercise in ameliorating systemic inflammatory response. In blood, an inflammatory  process  includes  a  series  of  occasions  with  dilation  of venules and arterioles, enhanced blood vessel permeability, and blood flow with percolation of leukocytes into the tissues [ 37 ]. In contrast, SESN2 is essential for exercise in reducing inflammatory response in skeletal muscles. Therefore, these results vary in different tissues due to the fact that skeletal muscle is able to rapidly adapt to drastic changes, while  the  changes  of  blood  content  is  more  complex  and  systematic during exercise [ 38 , 39 ].

A recent study has suggested that Liraglutide ameliorated HFD-induced the increase in body weight, fat mass and lipids levels through upregulating SESN2/- mediated  Nrf2/HO-1  pathway  [ 40 ].  SESN2/Nrf2  may  play  a  cardio- protective  role in  cardiac dysfunction  mice after 16-week  HFD  [ 41 ].

Since SESNs and Nrf2 play a critical role in anti-inflammatory actions [ 28 , 29 ], we sought to gain an insight into their relationship using bioinformatics prediction and immunoprecipi- tation experiments. Our data showed that only SESN2, as opposed to SESN1 and SESN3, had a protein-protein interaction with Nrf2. Addi- tionally, our results demonstrated that neither long-term HFD nor aer- obic exercise had an effect on the proteins binding of SESN1 or SESN3 and Nrf2, while long-term HFD led to a significant increase in the pro- teins binding of SESN2 and Nrf2.

Previous studies have indicated that physical exercise increases SESN2 protein in the skeletal muscle [ 4 , 16 \u2013 19 ]. However, the studies regarding SESN2 expression in HFD- induced disease models were inconsistent. While the protein of SESN2 was increased in the liver of rats fed with HFD [ 43 ], our previous study verified that SESN2 protein significantly increased in the skeletal muscle of HFD-fed mice [ 16 ]. On the contrary, the expression of SESN2 was reduced in the liver of HFD-fed mice [ 44 ]. Nonetheless, the protective function  of  different  SESNs  against  HFD  related  diseases  remained consistent.  Our  present  research  revealed  that  SESN2  protein  also notably increased in response to regular exercise in the skeletal muscle of WT mice. Moreover, HFD also induced an increase in SESN2 protein, which may be a self-protective mechanism of the organism. Further- more, we evaluated certain proteins related to the Nrf2 pathway in the skeletal muscle of WT and SESN2 \u2212 / \u2212 mice. Similarly, Nrf2 protein also significantly increased after long-term HFD and regular exercise in WT mice. This finding is in accordance with recent reports that exercise can augment the mRNA and protein expression of Nrf2 in skeletal muscle [ 25 , 26 ]. However, our data showed that SESN2 deficiency restrained the  exercise  effect  on  Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1  in  HFD-fed  mice,  indicating that SESN2 protein is essential for the exercise influences on the Nrf2 pathway in HFD-fed mice.", "type": "Text"}, {"left": 37.0, "top": 284.0, "width": 252.0, "height": 217.0, "page_number": 9, "page_width": 595, "page_height": 793, "text": "Despite the progress made in understanding the role of SESN2 and Nrf2 in anti-inflammatory effects, the exact regulatory mechanism re- mains to be elucidated.

While, Bae et al. found that overexpression of SESN2 activated Nrf2 by pro- moting the degradation of Keap1 and prevented oxidative liver damage [ 42 ]. It seems like that a positive feedback loop exists between SESN2 and Nrf2. Therefore, further studies are required to gain a more detailed understanding of the regulatory relationship between SESN2 and Nrf2 in models of chronic inflammation. To further investigate the connection between the two proteins, we examined the expression of inflammatory factors in PA + OA-treated C2C12 myotubes after SESN2 overexpression or Nrf2 inhibition. Our results showed that Nrf2 protein was signifi- cantly increased after Ad-Sesn2 treatment, while the proteins IL-6, IL-1 \u03b2 , and TNF- \u03b1 were concomitantly reduced, indicating that overexpression of  SESN2  promoted Nrf2  expression and improved the  inflammatory response in cells.

Chemerin, a novel adipo- kine, has been associated with renal damage in DN. The chemerin chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1) has been reported to participate in DN. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of a CMKLR1 antagonist, 2-(anaphtho- yl)ethyltrimethylammonium iodide ( \u03b1 -NETA), on DN. Methods: To induce diabetes, 8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were given a single intraperitoneal injection of 65 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ). Diabetic mice were randomly assigned to receive daily doses of 0, 5, or 10 mg/kg \u03b1 -NETA for 4 weeks.

Previous studies have suggested that serum levels of chemerin are elevated in the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and renal damage, with a negative correlation observed between chemerin levels and renal function [5 \u2013 8]. In addition, in the models of hypertensive nephropathy and glomerulonephritis, renal chemerin expression was found to be markedly upregu- lated, exhibiting a positive correlation with \ufb01 brotic and in \ufb02 ammatory markers [9]. Chemerin chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1) is the endogenous ligand of chem- erin. Upon binding to chemerin, the receptor promotes the release of calcium ions within cells, subsequently activating nuclear transcription factor (NF- \u03ba B) and cel- lular signaling pathways, including extracellular signal- regulated kinase 1 (ERK-1). Through these mechanisms, CMKLR1 plays a signi \ufb01 cant role in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, and in \ufb02 ammatory responses. Chemerin/CMKLR1 axis was reported to accelerate the in \ufb02 ammatory responses of glomerular endothelial cells in DN [10]. Furthermore, the CMKLR1 antagonist CCX832 was found to attenuate renal reactive oxygen species production in diabetic mice [10]. 2-(Anaphthoyl)ethyl- trimethylammonium iodide ( \u03b1 -NETA), a small molecule antagonist of CMKLR1, has been found to signi \ufb01 cantly inhibit central nervous system autoimmune in \ufb02 amma- tory disease, such as multiple sclerosis, which is achieved through the suppression of chemerin-triggered \u03b2 - arrestin2 association with CMKLR1, as well as CMKLR1+ cell migration [11].

In humans and rodents, high expression of FFAR1 is restricted to pancreatic and gastric endocrine cells, while expression in other tissues, including brain, is much lower [1,2,4,5] . These features make FFAR1 an attractive drug target for the treatment of insuf \ufb01 cient insulin secretion, which is the ultimate cause for the onset of hyperglycemia and type-2 diabetes mellitus [6,7] . Until today, multiple agonists have been generated and tested for their ef \ufb01 cacy to treat hyperglycemia in humans [6] . Although FFAR1 agonists coun- teract glucose intolerance in mice and humans, the bene \ufb01 cial effect of these new therapeutic drugs is still a matter of debate [8,9] . Thus, the promising drug TAK875 was discontinued after clinical phase III due to its liver toxicity. Con \ufb01 rming this side effect, FFAR1-de \ufb01 cient mice are protected against diet-induced liver steatosis [10] . This observation prompted the investigation of FFAR1-antagonists as therapeutic tools against fatty liver disease.", "type": "Text"}, {"left": 42.0, "top": 289.0, "width": 241.0, "height": 74.0, "page_number": 2, "page_width": 595, "page_height": 793, "text": "In addition, different FFAR1 agonists exert their effects through different cellular pathways. Thus, fatty acids stimulate insulin secretion mainly via Gq proteins, while TAK875 stimulation is mediated by b -arrestin-2 [11] . An additional, but indirect, stimulatory effect of FFAR1-agonists on insulin secretion is caused by the acti- vation of FFAR1 expressed in intestinal endocrine cells which leads to GLP-1 secretion [12] .", "type": "Text"}, {"left": 42.0, "top": 367.0, "width": 241.0, "height": 281.0, "page_number": 2, "page_width": 595, "page_height": 793, "text": "Several transgenic and knockout/congenic mouse models have been generated in order to assess the role of FFAR1 for proper insulin secretion and maintenance of glucose homeostasis. The results ob- tained with three different receptor knockout mouse models were not consistent. The protection against high fat feeding-induced fatty liver and glucose intolerance, as observed by Steneberg and colleagues, could not be reproduced using other Ffar1 KO mouse models [10,13,14] . Such differences may be explained by undesirable side effects generated by insertion of exogenous DNA, deletion of non- coding regions with speci \ufb01 c functions, e.g. microRNA, and the addi- tional role of the Ffar1 promoter for the expression of FFAR2 (GPR43) and FFAR3 (GPR41) [15,16] . Congenic mice differ not only in the ab- lated gene but also in a \ufb02 anking segment on either side of the ablated locus [17] . Furthermore, a complete deletion of a protein may generate a compensatory up-regulation of other proteins. To circumvent such problems, we searched for a coisogenic mouse model with a minimal genetic alteration producing a maximal effect. Using site-directed mutagenesis, several point mutations in Ffar1 with functional conse- quences have been identi \ufb01 ed, including R258 [18,19] . We screened the Munich ENU-mutagenesis-derived F1 sperm and corresponding DNA archive for point mutations in Ffar1 .

Indeed, dur- ing ipGTT, plasma fatty acid concentrations decline and, therefore, it is unlikely that FFAR1 contributes to insulin secretion during ipGTT [36] . Glucose homeostasis is further regulated by incretins, and FFAR1- agonists increase incretin release in rodents [12,37,38] . In contrast to the signi \ufb01 cantly different plasma glucose levels at 30 min after ip glucose administration, 30 min after an oral glucose load, plasma glucose levels were not signi \ufb01 cantly different between wild-type and Ffar1 R258W/R258W mice. GLP-1 secretion is stimulated by FFAR1 from the vascular but not from the luminal site, making it unlikely that FFAR1 is activated and augments incretin secretion during an oral glucose load when plasma fatty acids decline [36,38] . Plasma glucose ho- meostasis is maintained via an interaction of many organs, which generate a large variety of metabolic regulators.

Factors such as insulin resistance, increased free fatty acids, and changes in cytokine levels accompanying obesity exert a signifi- cant influence in the process of NAFLD [ 1 ]. The etiology of NAFLD remains mostly unclear although the two-hit and multi-hits theory has been brought up. In the two- hit theory, the first hit is the accumulation of triglycer- ides (TG) in hepatocytes while the second-hit is the hepatocellular injury, inflammation and fibrosis caused by inflammatory mediators. The multi-hits model mainly focuses on fatty acids and the metabolites. It is believed that insulin resistance enhances the hepatic deposition of free acids, further activates endoplasmic reticulum, oxidative stress and ultimately apoptosis of hepatocytes, in turn to facilitate the development of simple steatosis to steatohepatitis [ 2 \u2013 4 ]. The intestinal epithelium con- stitutes a barrier that separates the host from the food and microbiota in the gut. Fat in the daily diet, together with other factors, may cause gut microbiota dysbiosis, and alterations in intestinal permeability, thus resulting in NAFLD. Studies have also shown that gut microbiota and their products accelerate the progress of NAFLD [ 5 ].

Therefore, we investigated whether the beneficial effects of exendin-4 treatment on fatty liver are mediated via Sirt1 in high-fat (HF) diet-induced obese C57BL/6J mice and related cell culture models. Exendin-4 treatment decreased body weight, serum free fatty acid (FA), and triglyceride levels in HF-induced obese C57BL/6J mice. Histological analysis showed that exendin-4 reversed HF-induced hepatic accumulation of lipids and inflammation. Exendin-4 treatment increased mRNA and protein expression of Sirt1 and its downstream factor, AMPK, in vivo and also induced genes associated with FA oxidation and glucose metabolism. In addition, a significant increase in the hepatic expression of Lkb1 and Nampt mRNA was observed in exendin-4-treated groups. We also observed increased expression of phospho-Foxo1 and GLUT2, which are involved in hepatic glucose metabolism. In HepG2 and Huh7 cells, mRNA and protein expressions of GLP-1R were increased by exendin-4 treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Exendin-4 enhanced protein expression of Sirt1 and phospho-AMPK a in HepG2 cells treated with 0.4 mM palmitic acid. We also found that Sirt1 was an upstream regulator of AMPK in hepatocytes. A novel finding of this study was the observation that expression of GLP-1R is proportional to exendin-4 concentration and exendin-4 could attenuate fatty liver through activation of Sirt1.", "type": "Text"}, {"left": 66.0, "top": 383.0, "width": 474.0, "height": 15.0, "page_number": 1, "page_width": 612, "page_height": 790, "text": "Citation: Lee J, Hong S-W, Chae SW, Kim DH, Choi JH, et al.

Fatty acid oxidation in liver by 5- aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) and met- formin administration, an oral hypoglycemic agent, are also mediated by the activation of AMPK [26,27]. In our study, HF significantly decreased the expression of genes associated with fatty acid oxidation, including the Adipoq and Ppara target genes, such as MACD and Acox , which are key enzymes involved in mitochondrial and peroxisomal b -oxidation, respectively. Adiponectin, as the key regulator of fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle and liver, increases AMPK and PPAR a ligand activities. At this time, adiponectin-mediated modulation of AMPK depends on LKB [25,26]. These actions of adiponectin are mediated by Adipor1 and Adipor2, which serve as receptors for globular and full-length adiponectin. Indeed, it has been reported that Adipor1 and Adipor2 are abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle and liver, respectively [28]. In our experiments, expression of Adipor2 was increased in the exendin-4-treated group compared with HF group, whereas no change in expression of Adipor1 was observed between the exendin-4-treated group and HF group. Thus, this result suggests that the antidiabetic effects of exendin-4-increased adiponectin are mediated by Adipor2.

Higher level of lipogenic enzyme in the control group than the HF group can be explained by the difference in carbohydrate contents of the respective diets, due to the fact that dietary carbohydrate are transformed to fat via de novo lipogenesis processes.", "type": "Text"}, {"left": 57.0, "top": 714.0, "width": 239.0, "height": 18.0, "page_number": 9, "page_width": 612, "page_height": 790, "text": "In addition, conflicting results between previous studies and the present study with respect to expression of lipogenesis-associated", "type": "Text"}, {"left": 314.0, "top": 169.0, "width": 240.0, "height": 93.0, "page_number": 9, "page_width": 612, "page_height": 790, "text": "genes may be due to the use of different mouse models, namely genetically and diet-induced obese mice.

Diabetic neuropathy is an important factor leading to disability in diabetic patients [ 3 ]. It is estimated that in 2015, there were 415 million adults worldwide suffering from diabetes; additionally there are many undiagnosed adults who suffer from impaired glu- cose tolerance, which is a major risk factor for diabetes [ 4 ]. There is a common complication in people with dia- betes that is characterized by greater sensitivity to nox- ious stimuli than that of normal people (hyperalgesia) [ 5 ]. Clinically, the symptoms of diabetic peripheral neur- opathy seriously affect the quality of life and mental health of patients, so treating these symptoms of DPN in the clinic is a new challenge [ 6 ]. Currently, there are very few available therapies for diabetic neuropathy because therapeutic opportunities are lim- ited by many factors, such as serious adverse reac- tions and ineffectiveness.

Later, it was discovered that these pathways are linked by oxidative-nitrosative stress and that oxidative- nitrosative stress is related in some way to all known aetiologies of diabetic neuropathy [ 10 ]. Oxidative stress is one of the main potential mechanisms of painful dia- betic peripheral neuropathies. Oxidative stress can lead to neurological damage in a variety of neuropathies, including diabetic neuropathy, Charcot-Marie neur- opathy, and acrylamide-induced neuropathy [ 11 \u2013 14 ].

ROS can cause damage to peripheral nerves by increasing oxida- tive stress or attenuating the antioxidant defence systems [ 11 ]. They can cause DNA damage and cellular oxida- tion reactions such as protein oxidation and cell mem- brane lipid peroxidation [ 44 , 45 ]. However, the cells themselves have enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxi- dant defence systems that detoxify ROS, such as SOD and GPx. However, chronic stress in DPN destroys the antioxidant capacity of cells, leading to the development of abnormal oxidative stress and molecular changes associated with DPN [ 46 ]. Previous studies have identi- fied glucose-induced superoxide production as an important part of the pathophysiology of diabetic micro- vascular complications [ 10 ]. High doses of glucose cause NADH flux to increase the intensity of free radical pro- duction, which further leads to a series of reactions, such as protein nitration at tyrosine residues and DNA dam- age [ 47 ]. In the present study, the production of MDA by the sciatic nerves was increased in diabetic mice com- pared with normal control, indicating an increase in oxi- dative stress. But, diosgenin could ameliorated MDA. Our results also showed that diosgenin significantly in- creased the levels of SOD and GPx in sciatic nerves.

Adipose tis- sue,  unlike  other  organs,  grows  and  develops  continuously throughout life. To supply growing adipose tissues with nutri- ents and oxygen, the vasculature responds by increasing the number and/or size of blood vessels. In early stage develop- ment of adipose tissue, adipogenesis is tightly associated with angiogenesis (3). It was shown that exposure of mice to cold led to activation of angiogenesis in white and brown adipose tissues, associated with upregulation of proangiogenic factors and  downregulation  of  endogenous  angiogenesis  inhibitors (4).  Pro-  and  antiangiogenic  compounds  occurring  in  adi- pose tissue have been reviewed elsewhere (5). Several previous studies have suggested the potential to reduce adipose tissue development by inhitibion of angiogenesis (6\u20139).
